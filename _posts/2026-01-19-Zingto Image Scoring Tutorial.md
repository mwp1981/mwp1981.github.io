## Tutorial: Batch Photo Scoring with Zingto (Using Pixabay Free Images)

In this tutorial, we use free, copyright-free stock images from **Pixabay** (a popular free stock photo platform) for demonstration. Follow these steps to batch-score and filter high-quality images with Zingto:

### Step 1: Prepare Free Stock Images

In this tutorial, we use the free image library from Pixabay for demonstration. First, filter images with pixels larger than 800×600, published within the last 7 days, and exclude AI-generated ones, resulting in 286 free stock photos. Then, download them to your local computer using a batch download tool.

The Zingto scoring model will start batch analysis immediately—no manual intervention required. It automatically assigns a score (typically 0-10) to each image based on comprehensive quality metrics.

The batch analysis runs in the background, and you’ll see scores populate next to each image once completed. This process is optimized for speed, even with hundreds of high-resolution images.

### Step 4: Sort and Manage Images

The score filter has a default threshold of 6.5. Adjust this value to refine your selection: here, we set it to 7.9 to retain only the top 20 highest-rated images. Once filtered, right-click the list and choose **“Save Images As”** to store the high-quality pictures in a new folder for easy access.
