About This Tutorial
In this tutorial, we will use the landscape video Beautiful landscapes.mp4 as an example to illustrate how to extract high-score frames and create a demonstration short video with Zingto Image Scoring. The whole process is simple and straightforward, with clear steps and visual guidance.

Follow these steps to select highlight scenes from your landscape video and generate high-quality images (and optional short videos) with Zingto:

Step 1: FrameCapture – Select the target local video source
First, launch the Zingto Image Scoring software and switch to the FrameCapture module. Click the "Select Video" button, browse your local file system, and choose the target landscape video (Beautiful landscapes.mp4 in this demo). The software will automatically recognize the video format and display basic information (such as duration, resolution) after selection.

Step 2: The program automatically captures video frames
After selecting the video, the software will automatically start capturing video frames. You can preset the frame capture interval (default is 1 frame per second) according to your needs—shorter intervals capture more frames but take more storage space, while longer intervals are more efficient. The capture process runs in the background, and you’ll see a progress bar indicating the completion status.

Step 3: Score the saved images from the video frames
Once frame capture is complete, the software will automatically save all captured frames as images (in JPG/PNG format) to a default folder (you can customize the save path in settings). Next, switch to the "Scoring" module, and the software will batch score all saved images based on image quality, composition, color saturation and other metrics (score range: 0-10).

Step 4 (optional): MelodyFram – Browse and appreciate high-score images, and generate a short video
After scoring, switch to the MelodyFram module to browse all high-score images (you can filter images by setting a score threshold, e.g., only display images with scores ≥8). You can preview, favorite or delete unwanted images here. Finally, click the "Generate Short Video" button, select a background music file, and the software will combine the high-score images into a short demo video (supports MP4 format export).
